Configuration Files
===================

This is a collection of my configuration files (dotfiles). They are a mixture
of $HOME and /etc files that are tweaked to my likeing. Feel free to anything
you find usefull.

== dotman.sh ==
A simple script used for creating symlinks from git repo to relevant location

.Usage
[source,bash]
-------------
$ ./dotman.sh vim link
-------------

or to just copy the files
[source,bash]

$ ./dotman.sh vim backup
------------

== Adding configuration files ==
To add files that will deployed by dotman.sh, create a dir $PROGRAM. Then create
the file "$PROGRAM/files". each line represents one file/directory to sysmlink.
Format is $REPOFILE>$CONFIGFILE. Where $REPOFILE is the file relative to $PROGRAM,
and $CONFIGFILE is the file location relative to $HOME. See vim/files for examples.
